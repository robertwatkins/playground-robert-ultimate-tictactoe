# Common modules for the rest-tool

The 'rest-tool' is a simple Node.js command-line tool which can be used to document,
emulate and test RESTful APIs. 

This project is a Node.js module, that is used by the 'rest-tool' itself, and the REST API projects, that are generated by the tool.

This module is referred by the package.json files and automatically installed during the normal usage of the 'rest-tool', so you probably will not use it directly unless you are willing to develop your own code generator or templates.
